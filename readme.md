Can't say it is the worst thing, just a general observation. My class has been excellent about having reunions every 5 years. Our 8th installment is not too far off. They are very well attended and enjoyable. The one thing I noticed is that as the reunions go by, the folks who have been putting on a show for appearance sake give fewer and fewer fucks as the years pile up. You can see who has been ravaged by years of drug or alcohol abuse. The ones who have "let themselves go" physically - I'm not talking being a few pounds overweight. Some folks put in no effort to be hygienic in general.

Then there are the people who realized too late that when you treat people like shit, no one wants to be around you anymore.

There are shit talkers and "big deals" from HS who kept it going through the first few reunions. New cars, talking about their big houses and endless vacations. They don't talk shit anymore. They've maxed out their credit cards long ago and live life on borrowed time and money.

Some have just given up and you can see it. I found that to be profoundly sad. We're all too young to do that.

On the other hand, I see some old friends with a regular cadence. We catch up, get the low down on each other's families and talk fondly about a four year stretch of time that happened long ago.

This was not my reunion, but my husbands.

In high school my husband was (and still is) a very reserved and quiet person. He tolerates no BS though. I call him my John Wayne. He is also 6 years older than I am.

We arrive at the venue, and everyone is mingling. All of a sudden, a woman calls out my husband's name and runs over. He introduces me and she looses her ever loving mind.

Apparently she had been in love with him since elementary school but hadn't ever said anything and she planned on asking him on a date that night. She has no idea he was married or that his wife (me) was 7 months pregnant.

She bursts into tears and starts yelling at me incoherently. Turns out she is living with bipolar disorder and was also an addict at that time which is why she reacted that way. We still choose to leave less than 20 minutes of arriving though.
